/**
 * https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-coding-interview-patterns-java/solution-jump-game-i
 *
 * In a single-player jump game, the player starts at one end of a series of squares, with the goal of reaching the last square.
 * At each turn, the player can take up to s steps towards the last square, where s is the value of the current square.
 *
 * For example, if the value of the current square is 3, the player can take either 3 steps, or2 steps, or 1
 * step in the direction of the last square. The player cannot move in the opposite direction, that is, away from the last square.
 *
 * You have been tasked with writing a function to validate whether a player can win a given game or not.
 *
 * Youâ€™ve been provided with the nums integer array, representing the series of squares.
 * The player starts at the first index and, following the rules of the game, tries to reach the last index.
 *
 * If the player can reach the last index, your function returns TRUE; otherwise, it returns FALSE.
